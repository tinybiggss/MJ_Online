2. Resume page at `/resume/` is tracked by default
3. Access metrics via: Analytics → Web traffic → Pages
4. Page view count = proxy for download/career interest

**Interpretation:**
- High views = recruiter/employer interest
- Traffic spikes = potential hiring activity
- Combine with contact page views for full picture

**No Additional Setup Required**
