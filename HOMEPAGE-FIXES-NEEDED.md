# Homepage Fixes - Task #1

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Issue:** Empty sections on homepage (QA Audit findings)

## Root Cause

The homepage empty sections are NOT in the page content itself. They are generated by the **Kyoto theme** based on Ghost theme settings.

The custom homepage page (slug: `home`) has good content with 3 featured projects. However, the Kyoto theme is auto-generating these sections around the custom content:

1. **"Creating" section** - Empty (no posts tagged appropriately)
2. **"Case studies" section** - Empty (no posts display despite having case study posts)
3. **"Testimonials" section** - Empty (no testimonial posts)

## Current Homepage Structure

**Custom Page Content** (`/pages/home`):
- ✅ H1: Mike Jones
- ✅ Tagline: AI Implementation Expert and LLM Integration Specialist
- ✅ Intro paragraph (29 years...)
- ✅ Featured Work section with 3 projects:
  - NeighborhoodShare
  - Local LLM Setup
  - Velocity Partners
- ✅ Who I Am section
- ✅ Core Expertise section
- ✅ Let's Work Together section

**Theme-Generated Sections** (Kyoto theme auto-adds these):
- ❌ "Creating" section - EMPTY
- ❌ "Case studies" section - EMPTY
- ❌ "Testimonials" section - EMPTY
- ✅ "Thoughts" section - Shows blog posts correctly

## Why Case Studies Section is Empty

Ghost has 5 posts tagged "Projects" + "Featured":
1. Local LLM Infrastructure: Self-Hosted AI on Mac Mini
2. NeighborhoodShare: AI-Powered Community Tool Sharing Platform
3. NeighborhoodShare: Building Community Through Tool Sharing
4. Local LLM Setup: Self-Hosted AI Infrastructure
5. AI Memory System: Building Personal AI Workflow Automation

**However:** The theme's "Case studies" section is looking for a DIFFERENT tag or configuration than what we're using.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Disable Empty Sections in Theme Settings (RECOMMENDED)

Access Ghost Admin → Settings → Design → Site-wide settings
- Look for homepage section configuration
- Disable "Creating" section
- Disable "Testimonials" section
- Check why "Case studies" isn't showing posts (may need specific tag or featured toggle)

**OR**

### Option 2: Configure Sections to Display Correct Content

- **"Creating" section:** Either populate with posts tagged "Creating" OR disable
- **"Case studies" section:** Ensure case study posts are tagged with whatever the theme expects (may be "Case Study" tag needed, not just "Projects")
- **"Testimonials" section:** Disable (no testimonials collected yet)

### Option 3: Customize Theme Template

If theme settings don't allow disabling sections, can modify theme template files:
- `/content/themes/kyoto/index.hbs` or `/home.hbs`
- Comment out or remove empty section loops

## Immediate Action Required

**Access needed:** Ghost Admin UI (https://mikejones-online.ghost.io/ghost/)

**Steps:**
1. Log into Ghost Admin
2. Go to Settings → Design → Site-wide
3. Look for homepage sections configuration
4. Disable empty sections OR
5. Check theme documentation for homepage section settings

**Alternative approach:**
- Go to Posts
- Check if case study posts need additional tagging
- Try creating "Case Study" tag and applying to relevant posts
- Set case studies as "Featured" if theme requires that

## Test After Fix

After making changes, verify:
- [ ] Homepage loads cleanly (no empty sections)
- [ ] "Featured Work" custom content still displays
- [ ] "Thoughts" section still works
- [ ] No broken layout
- [ ] Mobile responsive still works

## Ghost Admin Access Note

This fix requires Ghost Admin UI access, which cannot be automated via API. The theme settings and homepage configuration need to be adjusted manually through the Ghost dashboard.
