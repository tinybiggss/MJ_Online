## Blocker Analysis

### Issue: Browser Extension Not Connected

**Impact:**
- Cannot automate Ghost admin access
- Cannot programmatically enable ActivityPub
- Cannot configure settings via automation
- Cannot test federation automatically

**Root Cause:**
Chrome extension required for browser automation is not connected or not functioning.

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. Called `tabs_context_mcp` to establish browser context
2. Attempted navigation to mikejones.online/ghost
3. Both returned "Browser extension not connected" error

**Workaround:**
Created comprehensive manual configuration guide that user can follow step-by-step without automation.

**Advantages of Manual Approach:**
1. **User Control:** User sees and controls all configuration decisions
2. **Learning:** User becomes familiar with Ghost admin interface
3. **Verification:** User can verify each step visually
4. **Troubleshooting:** User can identify any Ghost-specific UI variations
5. **Documentation:** Guide serves as reference for future configuration changes

**Future Automation:**
Once browser extension connection is resolved, automation could be added for:
- Testing WebFinger endpoint
- Verifying Mastodon search results
- Monitoring federation status
- Tracking engagement metrics
