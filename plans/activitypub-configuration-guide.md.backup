## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Access Ghost Admin

1. Navigate to: https://mikejones.online/ghost
2. Log in with your Ghost Pro credentials
3. You should see the Ghost dashboard

### Step 2: Locate ActivityPub Settings

According to Ghost documentation, ActivityPub settings are typically located at:

**Path 1 (Most Likely for Ghost Pro):**
- Settings → Membership → Fediverse
- OR Settings → Growth → Network

**Path 2 (Alternative Location):**
- Settings → Labs → ActivityPub
- OR Settings → Beta Features → Fediverse

**Note:** The exact location may vary based on Ghost version. Look for keywords: "ActivityPub", "Fediverse", "Network", or "Social Web".

### Step 3: Enable ActivityPub

1. Once you locate the ActivityPub/Fediverse settings section
2. Toggle the switch to **ON** (may be labeled "Enable Network", "Enable Fediverse", or "Enable ActivityPub")
3. Ghost Pro should automatically register with the managed ActivityPub service
4. Wait for confirmation message (may take 30-60 seconds)

**Expected Success Message:**
"Your site is now connected to the Fediverse" or similar confirmation.

**If you see an error:**
- Note the exact error message
- Try disabling and re-enabling after clearing browser cache
- See Troubleshooting section below

### Step 4: Configure ActivityPub Settings

Look for these configuration options (availability depends on Ghost version):

#### Content Settings
- **Post federation:** Choose which content types federate (posts, pages)
  - Recommended: Enable for "Posts" only (not pages)

- **Automatic federation:** Publish new posts to Fediverse automatically
  - Recommended: Enable

#### Profile Settings
- **Display name:** Your public name on the Fediverse
  - Recommended: "Mike Jones" or preferred professional name

- **Username:** Your Fediverse handle will be @username@mikejones.online
  - Recommended: "mike" (results in @mike@mikejones.online)
  - Note: Username may be set automatically based on your Ghost profile

- **Bio/Description:** Short bio for Fediverse profile
  - Recommended: Emphasize AI/ML expertise, portfolio focus
  - Example: "AI/ML Engineer | Building intelligent systems | Portfolio at mikejones.online"

  - Recommended: Enable

- **Show boosts:** Display Fediverse boosts/reposts on posts
  - Recommended: Enable

- **Show replies:** Display Fediverse replies as comments
  - Recommended: Enable

- **Allow replies:** Let Fediverse users reply to your posts
  - Recommended: Enable

#### Privacy Settings

  - Recommended: Enable

### Step 5: Save Configuration

1. Click "Save" or "Save settings" button
2. Wait for confirmation
3. Verify no error messages appear

---

## Verification and Testing

### Test 1: Verify Ghost Configuration

1. In Ghost admin, check ActivityPub status shows as "Active" or "Connected"
2. Your Fediverse handle should be displayed: @mike@mikejones.online (or your chosen username)

### Test 2: WebFinger Endpoint Test

WebFinger is the protocol that allows Fediverse servers to discover your ActivityPub profile.

**Using Command Line (Mac Terminal):**
```bash
curl https://mikejones.online/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:mike@mikejones.online
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "subject": "acct:mike@mikejones.online",
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "self",
      "type": "application/activity+json",
      "href": "https://mikejones.online/.ghost/activitypub/..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**If you get a 404 error:**
- Ghost Pro may handle WebFinger routing differently
- This is less critical for Ghost Pro (managed service handles it)
- Proceed to Mastodon test instead

### Test 3: Search from Mastodon

This is the most important test to verify federation is working.

**If you have a Mastodon account:**
1. Log into your Mastodon instance (mastodon.social, mastodon.online, etc.)
2. In the search bar, type: @mike@mikejones.online (use your actual username)
3. Click "Search" or press Enter
4. Your Ghost profile should appear in search results
5. Click "Follow" to follow your Ghost site

**If you don't have a Mastodon account:**
- Skip this test for now
- Consider creating a test account on mastodon.social for testing purposes
- Alternatively, ask someone with a Mastodon account to search for your profile

### Test 4: Publish Test Post

1. In Ghost admin, create a new post
2. Title: "Test Post - ActivityPub Federation"
3. Content: Brief test message
4. Set as "Published" (not Draft)
5. Publish the post

**If you have a Mastodon follower:**
- Check if the post appears in their timeline within a few minutes
- The post should show title, excerpt, and link back to your Ghost site

**If no Mastodon followers yet:**
- Post will federate when you gain followers
- Test with your own Mastodon account if you created one

### Test 5: Verify Engagement Display

1. If someone likes or boosts your post from Mastodon, verify the engagement appears in:
   - Ghost admin notifications
   - Post analytics/stats
   - Public post view (if engagement display is enabled)

---

## Profile Optimization

Once ActivityPub is enabled, optimize your Fediverse profile:

### Avatar/Profile Picture
1. Go to Settings → General → Publication Details
2. Upload professional headshot (recommended: 400x400px minimum)
3. This image will be used as your Fediverse avatar

### Bio/Description
1. Go to Settings → General → Description
2. Write compelling bio emphasizing:
   - AI/ML expertise
   - Portfolio purpose
   - Key skills or interests
   - Call to action (e.g., "Hire me", "View my work")

**Example Bio:**
"AI/ML Engineer specializing in local LLMs and intelligent systems. Building practical AI solutions. Portfolio and case studies at mikejones.online. Open to opportunities."

### Links
1. Add important links to Ghost site navigation
2. These may appear in Fediverse profile (implementation varies)
3. Recommended links:
   - Resume/CV
   - Projects page
   - Contact page
   - GitHub profile

---

## Content Strategy for ActivityPub

### Initial Content Plan

**Before promoting your Fediverse profile:**
1. Publish 2-3 high-quality posts (AI case studies or projects)
2. This gives new followers content to engage with immediately
3. Empty profiles get fewer followers

**Launch announcement:**
1. Create "Introduction" post explaining:
   - Who you are
   - What you'll post about (AI/ML projects, insights)
   - Your expertise and interests
   - How to follow you
2. Include relevant hashtags (see below)

### Hashtag Strategy

Use 3-5 relevant hashtags per post to increase discoverability.

**Core hashtags for AI/ML content:**
- #AI
- #MachineLearning
- #ArtificialIntelligence
- #LLM
- #LocalLLM
- #Python

**Portfolio/professional hashtags:**
- #Portfolio
- #Developer
- #WebDev
- #Tech
- #OpenSource (if applicable)

**Project-specific hashtags:**
Create consistent tags for ongoing projects:
- #AIMemorySystem
- #YourProjectName

### Posting Frequency Recommendations

**Long-form articles (Ghost posts):**
- 1-2 per week
- Focus on quality over quantity
- In-depth case studies, tutorials, project showcases

**Short-form notes (if available in Ghost):**
- 3-5 per week
- Quick updates, links, insights
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Work-in-progress shares

**Engagement:**
- Daily: Check notifications and reply to comments
- Build genuine relationships with followers

### Content Format Tips

**Optimize for Fediverse previews:**
- Write compelling first paragraph (appears in federated preview)
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Include featured image (becomes preview card)
- Front-load key information

**Link strategy:**
- Every Ghost post automatically includes link back to full article
- Encourage click-throughs with strong intro hooks
- Use clear calls to action

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Not Properly Configured" Error

**Symptoms:** Ghost shows ActivityPub as not properly configured after enabling

**Solution (Ghost Pro specific):**
1. Disable the ActivityPub/Network toggle
2. Clear your browser cache completely (Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+Delete on Windows)
3. Close and reopen browser
4. Log back into Ghost admin
5. Re-enable the ActivityPub/Network toggle
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for registration to complete

**If still not working:**
- Check Ghost status page (status.ghost.org) for service issues
- Contact Ghost support via email or forum

### Issue 2: Profile Not Searchable from Mastodon

**Symptoms:** Searching @mike@mikejones.online from Mastodon returns no results

**Solutions:**
1. Verify ActivityPub is enabled and showing as "Active" in Ghost admin
2. Wait 10-15 minutes after initial activation (propagation delay)
3. Try searching from different Mastodon instances
4. Verify your username is correct (check Ghost admin settings)
5. Try alternative search formats:
   - With @: @mike@mikejones.online
   - Without @: mike@mikejones.online
   - Full URL: https://mikejones.online

**If profile still not found:**
- Ghost Pro handles federation differently than self-hosted
- Contact Ghost support with:
  - Your site URL
  - Your expected Fediverse handle
  - Screenshot of ActivityPub settings showing "enabled"

### Issue 3: Posts Not Appearing in Follower Timelines

**Symptoms:** Followers don't see your new posts in their feeds

**Solutions:**
1. Verify post is "Published" (not Draft or Scheduled)
2. Check if "Automatic federation" is enabled in settings
3. Verify followers are actually following (check follower list in Ghost admin)
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for federation (not instant)
5. Check if post contains any federation-blocking content (very rare)

**Testing:**
- Publish another test post
- Check from your own Mastodon account if you're following yourself
- Ask a follower to confirm they see the post

### Issue 4: Engagement Not Appearing

**Symptoms:** Likes, boosts, or replies from Fediverse don't show up in Ghost

**Solutions:**
1. Verify engagement display settings are enabled
2. Check Ghost admin → Notifications for Fediverse interactions
3. Engagement may take a few minutes to appear
4. Some engagement may not federate due to privacy settings on the sender's side

### Issue 5: Wrong Username/Handle

**Symptoms:** Your Fediverse handle is not what you expected

**Solution:**
- Ghost typically uses your author slug as the username
- To change: Settings → Staff → Your profile → Author slug
- Note: Changing username after gaining followers may break existing follows
- Best to set correct username before promoting

## Ghost Pro vs Self-Hosted Differences

**Note:** The research document includes extensive self-hosted configuration (Nginx, Docker, etc.). Since mikejones.online is on Ghost Pro, you can ignore:

- Nginx/Apache reverse proxy configuration
- Docker Compose setup
- Manual WebFinger endpoint configuration
- Authorization header proxy settings
- Database configuration

**Ghost Pro handles all of this automatically.** Your only tasks are:
1. Enable ActivityPub in admin
2. Configure profile settings
3. Start publishing content

---

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Ghost Admin - ActivityPub Metrics

Look for these metrics in your Ghost admin (location varies by version):

**Follower metrics:**
- Total Fediverse followers
- Follower growth over time
- Followers by platform (Mastodon, Threads, Pixelfed, etc.)

**Engagement metrics:**
- Likes per post
- Boosts/reposts per post
- Replies per post
- Click-through rate to full articles

**Interaction tracking:**
- Ghost admin → Notifications shows:
  - New followers
  - Likes
  - Boosts
  - Replies from Fediverse users

### External Monitoring

**Fediverse search engines:**
- Search for your handle on various instances to see how your profile appears
- Monitor hashtag performance by searching for your tags

**Referral traffic:**
- Check Ghost analytics for referral traffic from Fediverse instances
- Common referrers: mastodon.social, mastodon.online, etc.

5. **Reach:** Access to 10+ million Fediverse users across multiple platforms
6. **Independence:** You own your content and platform while benefiting from federated discovery

---

## Limitations and Considerations

### Current Limitations (Ghost 6.x Beta)
- ActivityPub is still in beta - expect occasional issues
- Some features may be incomplete or subject to change
- Not all Fediverse platforms handle Ghost content identically
- Engagement metrics may have delays
- Some advanced ActivityPub features not yet supported

### Ghost Pro Advantages
- Zero infrastructure management (vs. self-hosted)
- Unlimited ActivityPub interactions (vs. 100/day on self-hosted free tier)
- Automatic updates and maintenance
- Ghost team handles all federation issues
- No need for Docker, databases, or custom reverse proxy configuration

### Content Considerations
- All federated content is public (no private posts to Fediverse)
- Once federated, posts are cached on other servers (deletion doesn't remove from all servers immediately)
- Edit functionality may be limited (depends on Ghost version)
- Long posts may be truncated in some Fediverse clients (full content on Ghost site)

---

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure ActivityPub success:

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Follower count:** Total Fediverse followers
- **Follower growth rate:** New followers per week/month
- **Engagement rate:** Likes + boosts + replies per post
- **Click-through rate:** Fediverse users clicking through to full articles
- **Referral traffic:** Traffic from Fediverse instances (check Ghost analytics)

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Interaction quality:** Meaningful comments and discussions
- **Network building:** Connections with AI/ML professionals
- **Brand awareness:** Mentions and shares of your work
- **Opportunities:** Job inquiries, collaboration requests, speaking invites

### Realistic Expectations
- **Month 1:** 10-50 followers (with consistent posting and engagement)
- **Month 3:** 50-200 followers (with quality content and networking)
- **Month 6:** 200-500 followers (with established presence and reputation)

**Note:** Fediverse growth is slower but more authentic than algorithmic platforms. Focus on quality over quantity.
