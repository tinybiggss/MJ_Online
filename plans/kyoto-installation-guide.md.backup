## Troubleshooting

### Theme Won't Upload
- **Check file size:** Ghost Pro has upload limits (typically 50MB)
- **Verify file format:** Must be .zip, not unzipped folder
- **Check Ghost version:** Ensure Ghost Pro is running v6.x
- **Browser issues:** Try different browser or clear cache

### Theme Activates But Looks Broken
- **Clear browser cache:** Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
- **Check theme version:** Ensure it's compatible with your Ghost version
- **View console errors:** F12 → Console tab for JavaScript errors
- **Contact support:** Themex Studio support if theme-specific issue

### Dark Mode Not Working
- **Check theme settings:** Settings → Design → Customize
- **Verify preset selection:** Ensure dark mode preset is selected
- **Browser settings:** Some browsers override dark mode
- **Custom CSS conflicts:** Check if any custom CSS is interfering

### Pages Missing Templates
- **Recreate page:** Delete and create new page
- **Check page settings:** Template dropdown should show Kyoto templates
- **Reinstall theme:** Upload theme again if templates missing
- **Contact support:** May be theme configuration issue
