# Theme Selection Decision - Phase 2.1

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Decision Maker:** Agent (with user approval pending)
**Phase:** 2.1 - Theme Selection & Installation

---

## Executive Decision

**Selected Theme:** Kyoto by Themex Studio
**Price:** $89 (one-time, lifetime updates)
**Vendor:** https://themex.studio/kyoto/

---

## Decision Rationale

### Why Kyoto?

1. **Portfolio-Optimized Design**
   - 10+ custom page templates (homepage, portfolio, blog, case studies, timeline, books)
   - Dedicated project showcase templates perfect for AI implementation projects
   - Designed specifically for developers, designers, makers, and solopreneurs

2. **Excellent Dark Mode Support**
   - 8 color presets: Default, Pure, Onyx, Rust, Fossil, Mint, Ice, Ember
   - Professional dark themes that align with tech aesthetic
   - User-selectable without code changes

3. **Technical Excellence**
   - Ghost 6.x compatible (ensures ActivityPub integration)
   - 100/100 SEO score
   - Responsive and speed-optimized
   - Clean, minimal Japan-inspired design

4. **Best Value Proposition**
   - $89 with lifetime updates
   - $30 cheaper than Fumio while providing all essential features
   - Professional quality saves 10-20 hours of custom development
   - No subscription fees

5. **Professional Aesthetic**
   - Minimal, modern design aligns with AI implementation focus
   - Won't appear dated as trends change
   - Professional enough for portfolio and personal brand

### Why Not Alternatives?

**Fumio ($119)**
- Pros: 5 project layouts, exceptional customization
- Cons: $30 more expensive, may be overkill for initial needs
- Verdict: Features can be added later if needed; not worth extra cost now

**Edge (Free)**
- Pros: Free, official Ghost theme, minimal aesthetic
- Cons: No confirmed dark mode, basic portfolio features, requires significant CSS work
- Verdict: Would save $89 but cost 10-20 hours of development time (~$500-1000 opportunity cost)

**Other Free Themes**
- Most are blog-focused rather than portfolio-focused
- Would require extensive customization
- Limited or no dark mode support
- Uncertain maintenance status

---

## Investment Analysis

**Cost:** $89 one-time payment

**Value Delivered:**
- Professional design (worth ~$1,500-3,000 if custom-built)
- Development time saved: 10-20 hours
- Opportunity cost savings: ~$500-1,000
- Lifetime updates: Ongoing compatibility maintenance
- 8 dark mode presets: Additional customization saved

**ROI:** Excellent - pays for itself in time savings alone
