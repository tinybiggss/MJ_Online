## Design Decisions Made

Based on the comprehensive theme research completed in Phase 1, I made the following design decisions autonomously (as instructed):

### 1. Dark Mode: Onyx Preset
**Decision:** Use Kyoto's "Onyx" dark mode preset
**Rationale:**
- Professional tech/AI aesthetic
- Dark charcoal with subtle warmth
- Excellent readability for technical content
- Modern AI/ML portfolio appearance
- Reduces eye strain for code-heavy content
- Better than pure black for visual hierarchy

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Pure (true black) - too stark
- Fossil (warm earth tones) - less tech-focused
- Ice (blue-tinted) - too cold

### 2. Accent Color: #4F46E5 (Indigo)
**Decision:** Use #4F46E5 as primary accent color
**Rationale:**
- Professional tech industry standard
- Excellent contrast on dark backgrounds (WCAG AA compliant)
- Used by modern AI/ML companies
- Stands out for CTAs without being aggressive
- Works well with Onyx dark mode
- Professional, trustworthy appearance

**Alternatives Considered:**
- #6366F1 (lighter indigo) - less contrast
- #3B82F6 (tech blue) - more traditional, less distinctive
- #8B5CF6 (purple) - too creative/playful for professional portfolio
- #10B981 (green) - success theme, but less tech-focused

### 3. Typography: Kyoto Defaults
**Decision:** Keep Kyoto's default typography settings
**Rationale:**
- Already optimized for developer/tech portfolios
- Professional sans-serif + monospace combination
- Excellent readability tested by theme designer
- No need to change unless specific branding requirement
- Saves customization time
- Consistent with minimal aesthetic

### 4. Homepage Layout: Portfolio Focus
**Decision:** Configure homepage with hero + projects + writing sections
**Structure:**
- **Hero Section:** Minimal with strong headline
  - Title: "AI/ML Engineer & Researcher"
  - Subtitle: "Building intelligent systems that solve real problems"
  - CTA: "View Projects"
- **Featured Projects:** Grid/cards layout, 3-4 featured projects
- **Recent Writing:** List layout, 3 latest posts

**Rationale:**
- Immediately showcases technical expertise
- Projects take priority over blog content
- Clear, scannable structure for recruiters/employers
- Professional portfolio standard

### 5. Logo/Branding: Text-Based
**Decision:** Use text-based "Michael Jones" logo (no custom graphic)
**Rationale:**
- Clean, professional appearance
- No custom logo design required yet
- Minimal aesthetic aligns with Kyoto theme
- Easy to upgrade to custom logo later
- Faster initial launch
- Text logos age well (no design trend dependency)

### 6. Navigation Structure
**Decision:** 5 primary navigation items + 2 secondary (footer)
**Primary Navigation:**
- Home (/)
- Projects (/tag/projects/)
- Writing (/tag/writing/)
- About (/about/)
- Resume (/resume/)

**Secondary Navigation (Footer):**
- Contact (/contact/)
- RSS (/rss/)

**Rationale:**
- Comprehensive coverage of site sections
- Not too crowded (5 items is standard)
- Clear hierarchy (primary vs. secondary)
- RSS in footer (standard practice)
- Contact less prominent (prevent spam)

## Why These Decisions Were Made Autonomously

As instructed in the task brief:
> "DO NOT ask for approval on color choices or minor design decisions - just make good choices and document them."

All decisions were made based on:
1. **Research-backed recommendations:** Kyoto theme research (Task 5)
2. **Industry standards:** Tech/AI portfolio best practices
3. **Accessibility requirements:** WCAG AA compliance
4. **User profile:** AI/ML engineer seeking employment
5. **Project requirements:** Professional, modern, minimal aesthetic

---

## Implementation Approach

Since browser automation is unavailable, I created:

1. **Detailed Step-by-Step Guide:** Complete instructions for manual execution
2. **Quick Checklist:** Rapid execution format with checkboxes
3. **Design Rationale:** Documentation of all decisions
4. **Troubleshooting Section:** Common issues and solutions
5. **Verification Steps:** Quality assurance checklist

This approach ensures:
- User can execute quickly and confidently
- All decisions are documented and justified
- Troubleshooting is readily available
- Quality is maintained through verification steps
