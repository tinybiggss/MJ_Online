## Implementation Recommendations for MJ_Online

### Phase 1: Theme Selection Decision
**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Test Free Option First:** Start with **Edge** to validate Ghost workflow and basic portfolio structure
2. **Evaluate Premium Needs:** Determine if project showcase complexity requires Fumio's 5 layouts or Kyoto's templates are sufficient
3. **Make Purchase Decision:** Upgrade to **Kyoto** (best value) or **Fumio** (maximum flexibility) based on Phase 1 learnings

### Phase 2: Theme Customization Requirements
Regardless of theme chosen, plan for:
- Custom CSS for AI project badges/tags
- Color palette customization (AI-forward aesthetic)
- Typography configuration (modern sans-serif + monospace for code)
- Logo/branding integration
- Navigation structure customization
- Custom page templates if needed (About, Resume, Contact, Project case studies)

### Phase 3: Dark Mode Implementation
- **If Kyoto/Fumio:** Configure preferred dark mode preset
- **If Edge:** Implement custom dark mode CSS or JavaScript toggle
- **If Other Free Theme:** Evaluate dark mode support and implement if missing

### Additional Considerations

**Ghost Version Compatibility:**
- Ensure chosen theme supports Ghost 6.x for ActivityPub integration (Kyoto, Fumio, Edge confirmed)
- Check release notes if using community themes

**Customization Complexity:**
- Premium themes (Kyoto, Fumio) offer built-in customization interfaces
- Free themes may require direct template file editing
- Consider development time when comparing free vs. premium

**Long-term Maintenance:**
- Official Ghost themes (Edge, Alto, Lumi, Mason) guaranteed updates
- Premium themes (Kyoto, Fumio) include lifetime updates
- Community themes (Liebling, SREDevOps) depend on maintainer activity

**Testing Strategy:**
1. Install theme in Ghost dev environment
2. Create sample project case study pages
3. Test responsive design across devices
4. Verify dark mode functionality
5. Assess customization difficulty
6. Evaluate performance (Lighthouse scores)
