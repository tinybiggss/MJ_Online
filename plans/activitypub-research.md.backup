# Ghost ActivityPub Integration Research

**Research Date:** 2026-01-27
**Researcher:** Agent-Beta
**Purpose:** Research ActivityPub integration for MJ_Online Ghost website

---

## Executive Summary

Ghost officially integrated ActivityPub support in late 2024-2025, with full rollout in Ghost V6 (August 2025). This integration enables Ghost websites to become part of the Fediverse, allowing readers to follow, interact with, and discover content across Mastodon, Threads, Pixelfed, and other ActivityPub-compatible platforms.

**Key Findings:**
- **Native Support:** Ghost 6.x includes built-in ActivityPub integration
- **Managed Service Available:** Ghost provides hosted ActivityPub server (free up to 100 interactions/day for self-hosted)
- **Self-Hosting Option:** Full self-hosting available via Docker Compose for unlimited interactions
- **Current Status:** Beta, actively maintained and improving

**Recommendation:** Use Ghost's managed ActivityPub service for initial launch (free tier sufficient for early-stage site), with option to self-host if/when exceeding 100 daily interactions.

## What is ActivityPub?

ActivityPub is an open, decentralized social networking protocol that enables different platforms and websites to communicate and share content. It powers the "Fediverse" - a network of interconnected social platforms including:

- **Mastodon** (Twitter-like microblogging)
- **Threads** (Meta's federated platform)
- **Pixelfed** (Instagram-like photo sharing)
- **Flipboard** (News aggregation)
- **WriteFreely** (Blogging platform)
- **Buttondown** (Newsletter platform)
- **Tumblr** (Blogging/social)
- **WordPress** (with plugins)
- **PeerTube** (Video platform)

When Ghost sites enable ActivityPub, they become federated actors that can be followed and interacted with from any of these platforms.

## Ghost's ActivityPub Implementation

### Architecture Overview

Ghost's ActivityPub integration uses a **multi-tenant ActivityPub server** built with **Fedify**. The architecture follows these principles:

**Technical Architecture:**
- Domain-Driven Design with immutable entities
- Event-driven patterns
- Result type pattern for explicit error handling
- Class-based architecture with dependency injection
- Repository pattern (services orchestrate business logic, repositories handle data)
- Hash-based database lookups (SHA256 hashes for ActivityPub identifiers)

**Request Routing:**
The ActivityPub service proxies specific routes:
- `/.ghost/activitypub/*` - ActivityPub API endpoints
- `/.well-known/webfinger` - WebFinger protocol for actor discovery
- `/.well-known/nodeinfo` - Node information for federation metadata

All other traffic routes to Ghost normally.

### How It Works

**Publishing Workflow:**
1. Publisher writes post in Ghost
2. Ghost generates ActivityPub Create activities
3. Activities sent to followers' inboxes on federated servers (Mastodon, Pixelfed, etc.)
4. Content appears in followers' feeds across the Fediverse
5. Interactions (likes, replies, boosts) flow back to Ghost site

**Reader Workflow:**
1. User on Mastodon/other platform searches for or discovers Ghost site
2. User follows `@username@yourdomain.com`
3. Ghost posts appear in their federated timeline
4. User can like, reply, boost, or click through to full post on Ghost site

**Unified Feed:**
Ghost provides an ActivityPub inbox where publishers can:
- Follow people and publications across the Fediverse
- View federated content within Ghost admin
- Interact with ActivityPub content from Ghost interface

## Setup Options

### Option 1: Ghost Pro Hosted Service (Recommended for Hosted Ghost)

**Requirements:**
- Ghost Pro subscription (any tier)
- Ghost 6.x or later

**Setup:**
1. Navigate to Ghost Admin → Settings → Growth → Network
2. Toggle "Network" switch to ON
3. Ghost automatically registers with managed ActivityPub service
4. Your site becomes `@yourusername@yourdomain.com`

**Benefits:**
- Zero configuration required
- Automatic updates and maintenance
- Unlimited ActivityPub interactions
- Full feature access
- No infrastructure management

**Cost:** Included in Ghost Pro subscription (no additional fees)

---

### Option 2: Self-Hosted Ghost + Managed ActivityPub Service (Recommended for MJ_Online)

**Requirements:**
- Self-hosted Ghost 6.x installation
- Domain with SSL/TLS (HTTPS required)
- Reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache, Caddy)

**Setup Steps:**

#### Step 1: Update Nginx Configuration
Edit your Nginx config (typically `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/yourdomain.com.conf`):

```nginx
# Allow ACME challenge for SSL (replace broad .well-known rule)
location /.well-known/acme-challenge {
    # Your existing ACME configuration
}

# Proxy ActivityPub endpoints to Ghost's managed service
location /.ghost/activitypub/ {
    proxy_pass https://ap.ghost.org;
    proxy_set_header Host ap.ghost.org;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;  # CRITICAL: Include auth header
}

location /.well-known/webfinger {
    proxy_pass https://ap.ghost.org;
    proxy_set_header Host ap.ghost.org;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;  # CRITICAL: Include auth header
}

location /.well-known/nodeinfo {
    proxy_pass https://ap.ghost.org;
    proxy_set_header Host ap.ghost.org;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;  # CRITICAL: Include auth header
}
```

**CRITICAL:** The `Authorization` header proxy is required but often missing from documentation. Without it, JWKS resource generation fails.

#### Step 2: Reload Nginx
```bash
sudo nginx -t  # Test configuration
sudo nginx -s reload  # Apply changes
```

#### Step 3: Enable in Ghost Admin
1. Navigate to Settings → Growth → Network
2. Toggle Network switch OFF (if previously attempted)
3. **Clear browser cache** (critical - prevents redirect loop caching)
4. Toggle Network switch ON
5. Ghost registers with `ap.ghost.org` managed service

#### Step 4: Verify Federation
1. Test WebFinger: `curl https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:username@yourdomain.com`
2. Search for `@username@yourdomain.com` from Mastodon instance
3. Follow your Ghost site from Mastodon
4. Publish test post and verify it appears in Mastodon timeline

**Benefits:**
- Free up to 100 interactions/day
- No infrastructure management for ActivityPub
- Automatic updates from Ghost
- Easy setup and maintenance
- Sufficient for most small-to-medium sites

**Limitations:**
- 100 interactions/day limit (interactions = create post/note + replies + likes + reposts)
- Dependent on Ghost's managed service availability

**Cost:** Free (up to 100 interactions/day)

**When to Upgrade:** If your site consistently exceeds 100 daily interactions (highly active community, viral posts, large follower base), consider self-hosting ActivityPub completely.

---

### Option 3: Fully Self-Hosted ActivityPub Server

**Requirements:**
- Self-hosted Ghost 6.x (installed from source, not Ghost-CLI)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MySQL database
- Public-facing domain (port 80 accessible, not just 2368)
- Reverse proxy with proper routing
- Technical expertise for troubleshooting

**Setup Steps:**

#### Step 1: Install Ghost from Source
Ghost's Docker-based ActivityPub requires source installation rather than Ghost-CLI installation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost.git
cd Ghost
yarn install
```

#### Step 2: Configure Docker Compose
Create `docker-compose.yml` with ActivityPub containers:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  ghost:
    # Your existing Ghost configuration

  activitypub:
    image: ghost/activitypub:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@mysql:3306/activitypub
      - GHOST_URL=https://yourdomain.com
    depends_on:
      - mysql

  activitypub-migrate:
    image: ghost/activitypub:latest
    command: migrate
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@mysql:3306/activitypub
    depends_on:
      - mysql

  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    # MySQL configuration
```

#### Step 3: Configure Ghost
Edit `config.local.json`:

```json
{
  "url": "https://yourdomain.com",
  "activitypub": {
    "enabled": true,
    "url": "http://activitypub:3000"
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Configure Reverse Proxy
Route ActivityPub requests to the activitypub container (port 3000) instead of `ap.ghost.org`.

#### Step 5: Start Services
```bash
docker-compose up -d
yarn dev:standalone && yarn logs  # ActivityPub service
yarn dev  # Ghost
```

#### Step 6: Enable in Ghost Admin
Same as Option 2 (Settings → Growth → Network → Toggle ON)

**Benefits:**
- Unlimited ActivityPub interactions
- Full control over infrastructure
- No external service dependencies
- Complete data ownership

**Challenges:**
- Complex setup and configuration
- Requires Docker/containerization knowledge
- Additional infrastructure to maintain
- More debugging required if issues arise
- Database management overhead

**Cost:** Infrastructure costs (server resources for additional containers)

**Best For:** Large sites exceeding 100 daily interactions, organizations requiring complete data control, technically proficient teams

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Not Properly Configured" Error
**Symptoms:** Ghost shows ActivityPub as not properly configured after enabling

**Solutions:**
1. Verify reverse proxy includes Authorization header in proxy config
2. Check that `/.well-known/webfinger` and `/.well-known/nodeinfo` routes are proxied correctly
3. Ensure `/.well-known/acme-challenge` is NOT blocking WebFinger requests
4. Disable Network toggle, clear browser cache, re-enable
5. Check Ghost logs for specific error messages

### Issue 2: 401 Authorization Errors
**Cause:** Missing Authorization header in reverse proxy configuration

**Solution:** Add `proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;` to all ActivityPub location blocks

### Issue 3: JWKS_MISSING Error
**Cause:** WebFinger route blocked or misconfigured, preventing JWKS resource generation

**Solution:**
1. Replace broad `location /.well-known` with specific `location /.well-known/acme-challenge`
2. Add specific `location /.well-known/webfinger` proxy rule
3. Reload reverse proxy configuration

### Issue 4: SITE_MISSING Error
**Cause:** Ghost site not registered with ActivityPub service

**Solution:**
1. Disable Network toggle in Ghost admin
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Re-enable Network toggle
4. Wait for registration to complete (may take a few minutes)

### Issue 5: Browser Redirect Loop
**Cause:** Browser cached incorrect redirect for ActivityPub endpoints

**Solution:** Clear browser cache completely before re-enabling Network toggle

### Issue 6: WebFinger Not Responding
**Cause:** Reverse proxy not routing WebFinger requests correctly

**Test:**
```bash
curl https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:username@yourdomain.com
```

**Solution:** Verify reverse proxy has specific WebFinger location block proxying to correct endpoint
