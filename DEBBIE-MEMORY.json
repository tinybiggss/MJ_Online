Root cause: Kyoto theme auto-generates sections ('Creating', 'Case studies', 'Testimonials') based on post tags - sections are empty because posts don't have expected tags. Custom page content is excellent (no changes needed). Created 5 comprehensive fix documents with immediate CSS solution (5 min) and alternative approaches. Ghost Admin API doesn't expose theme settings, so fix requires manual Ghost Admin UI work or code injection. Recommended: CSS injection to hide empty sections (fastest path to launch). Deliverables ready for Mike to implement."
