## Important Update: New Comprehensive Technical Documentation Available

Hi Alice,

**I'm assigning you NEW case study work using MUCH more comprehensive source material than what was available on February 2.**

### What Changed

**February 2 (Your Previous Drafts):**
- You created initial case study drafts based on limited documentation
- NeighborhoodShare: 356 lines
- Local LLM: 13KB
- AI Memory: 12KB
- Source: Basic project descriptions and existing materials

**February 3-4 (NEW - Ted's Comprehensive Interviews):**
- Ted conducted in-depth technical interviews with Mike
- NeighborhoodShare: **2,826 lines** (8x more detail!)
- Local LLM: **1,705 lines** (much more comprehensive!)
- Source: Structured technical interviews extracting implementation details, architecture, decisions, metrics

### Why This Matters

Ted's documentation includes:

**NeighborhoodShare NEW details:**
- ✅ AI-powered tool categorization using OpenAI GPT-4o Vision
- ✅ Dual-authentication state machine preventing disputes
- ✅ Beta expansion with zip code clustering and Captain governance
- ✅ Security incident response (API key theft + resolution)
- ✅ Real metrics: 170 users, 20 zip codes, 75-80 tools
- ✅ Development approach: AI-assisted development with Replit
- ✅ Full tech stack details: React + TypeScript + Node.js + PostgreSQL
- ✅ Market validation insights

**Local LLM NEW details:**
- ✅ Three-service architecture: Ollama + Open WebUI + mcpo (MCP bridge)
- ✅ Model Context Protocol integration for filesystem access
- ✅ Specific model: Qwen 2.5:14B with tool support
- ✅ RAG implementation with nomic-embed-text embeddings
- ✅ Complete auto-start infrastructure with LaunchAgents
- ✅ Hardware specs: Mac Mini M4 Pro, 24GB RAM, 4TB storage
- ✅ Performance metrics and comparison to cloud APIs

## Your New Assignment

### Task 3.8: NeighborhoodShare Case Study (START HERE - TOP PRIORITY)

**Instructions file:** `/Users/michaeljones/Dev/MJ_Online/ALICE-TASK-3.8-INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**Primary source:** `/content-drafts/neighborhoodshare-technical-doc.md` (Ted's 2,826-line comprehensive doc)

**Assets available:**
- 19 screenshots in `/assets/projects/neighborhoodshare/`
- 2 logos (house + words)
- 10 RAG entries (IDs 098-107) for fact-checking

**Target:** Ghost post at `/projects/neighborhoodshare`

**What to do:**
1. **Read Ted's comprehensive technical documentation** (`/content-drafts/neighborhoodshare-technical-doc.md`)
2. **Read the detailed instructions** I created for you (`ALICE-TASK-3.8-INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
3. **Create NEW Ghost case study** following the structure in the instructions
4. **Use 6-10 of the 19 screenshots** with captions
5. **Emphasize:** AI integration, full-stack capabilities, state machine sophistication, professional engineering
6. **Publish to Ghost** with proper tags (Projects, Featured, Full Stack, AI Integration, Community Platform)

### Task 3.7: Local LLM Setup Case Study (NEXT - AFTER 3.8)

**Primary source:** `/content-drafts/local-llm-technical-doc.md` (Ted's 1,705-line doc)

**Target:** Ghost post at `/projects/local-llm-setup`

**What to do:**
1. Read Ted's comprehensive Local LLM documentation
2. Create case study emphasizing AI infrastructure expertise
3. Highlight: MCP integration, RAG implementation, 3-service architecture
4. Publish to Ghost

## What About Your February 2 Drafts?

**Your old drafts were good starting points, but:**
- They were based on limited information
- Ted's interviews provide 8x more technical depth
- Real metrics, verified facts, specific implementation details now available

**Recommendation:** Use Ted's comprehensive docs as your PRIMARY source. You can reference your old drafts if useful, but the case studies should be substantially rewritten/expanded based on Ted's new material.

---

## Why Ted's Documentation is Better

### Example: NeighborhoodShare AI Feature

**Your Feb 2 draft might have said:**
"Uses AI to categorize tools from photos"

**Ted's comprehensive doc provides:**
- Specific API: OpenAI GPT-4o Vision
- User workflow: 2-4 angles including text/labels
- Processing time: 30-60 seconds
- What it extracts: tool name, category, brand (DeWalt, Milwaukee), power type, condition, description
- Development effort: ~1 week to develop effective prompts
- Impact: Dramatically reduces friction, users don't manually enter details
- Can identify specific models from labels and assess condition visually

**See the difference?** The new docs provide the depth employers want to see.

## Verification & Quality Control

**Use these resources to ensure accuracy:**

1. **Primary source:** Ted's technical documentation (trust this first)
2. **RAG knowledge base:** `/Cowork/content/rag/knowledge.jsonl` (fact-check against 110 verified entries)
3. **Visual assets:** All screenshots in `/assets/projects/` folders
4. **Instructions:** My detailed instructions in `ALICE-TASK-3.8-INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**If unsure about any technical detail:**
- Check Ted's doc first
- Cross-reference with RAG entries
- Ask Mike if still unclear

---

## Timeline

**Start NOW on Task 3.8 (NeighborhoodShare)**

This is your TOP PRIORITY. The comprehensive documentation Ted created is exactly what we need to showcase Mike's capabilities to employers.

**Estimated time:**
- Task 3.8 (NeighborhoodShare): 3-4 hours
- Task 3.7 (Local LLM): 3-4 hours
- Total: 6-8 hours for both case studies

---

## Success Criteria

Each case study complete when:
- ✅ Published to Ghost as post (not page)
- ✅ Based primarily on Ted's comprehensive technical documentation
- ✅ Includes 6-10 well-captioned screenshots
- ✅ Emphasizes technical sophistication and professional engineering
- ✅ Properly tagged (Projects, Featured, relevant tech tags)
- ✅ SEO optimized (meta description, excerpt, featured image)
- ✅ All facts verified against source materials
- ✅ Accessible at public URL (mikejones.online/projects/...)

---

## Questions?

If you have any questions:
1. Check the detailed instructions file first (`ALICE-TASK-3.8-INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
2. Review Ted's technical documentation
3. Ask Mike if you need clarification on technical accuracy
4. Report back when Task 3.8 is complete

---

## Summary

**OLD (Feb 2):** Case study drafts based on limited info → 356 lines
**NEW (Feb 3-4):** Ted's comprehensive technical docs → 2,826 lines

**Your assignment:** Create compelling Ghost case studies using Ted's comprehensive documentation as your primary source. This is essentially NEW work, not just updating old drafts.

**Start with:** Task 3.8 NeighborhoodShare (instructions ready, all assets available, comprehensive 2,826-line technical doc)

---

**Please acknowledge receipt of this assignment and confirm you understand:**
1. You're using Ted's NEW comprehensive documentation (not your Feb 2 drafts)
2. Task 3.8 NeighborhoodShare is your top priority
3. You have all source materials and instructions needed

**Let me know when you start and when Task 3.8 is complete!**
