---

### Estimated Effort

**Ted Interview + Documentation:** 1-2 hours
**Alice Case Study Creation:** 2-3 hours
**Total:** 3-5 hours

---

## PRIORITY 3: AI Memory System (OPTIONAL - LOW PRIORITY)

### Why Lower Priority

**Redundancy with Local LLM:**
- Local LLM already covers memory systems
- Both demonstrate AI infrastructure
- Somewhat overlapping value proposition

**Could be valuable if:**
- Want to emphasize cross-platform memory (ChatGPT + Claude)
- Workflow automation angle is compelling
- Different from Local LLM in meaningful ways

---

### What It Would Showcase

**If pursued:**
- Cross-platform AI memory
- Workflow automation
- Integration with commercial AI services
- Context persistence

---

### Decision Point

**Post-launch:** Assess whether this adds enough new value beyond Local LLM case study.

---

## Post-Launch Case Study Priority Queue

### Immediate Post-Launch (Phase 7.3 - After Chatbot Built)

**1. MikeJones.online Website & AI Chatbot** ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
- Meta/self-referential case study
- Demonstrates practical AI implementation
- RAG architecture showcase
- Agent coordination example
- **Estimated:** 5-7 hours

### Mid-Term Post-Launch (Phase 7.4+)

**2. Home Media Server** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Infrastructure/systems administration
- Different from AI projects (shows breadth)
- Self-hosting and privacy expertise
- **Estimated:** 3-5 hours

### Optional Post-Launch (Evaluate Later)

**3. AI Memory System** - LOW PRIORITY
- Evaluate if adds enough new value
- May be redundant with Local LLM
- Cross-platform angle could be interesting
- **Estimated:** 4-6 hours (if pursued)

---

## Timeline Recommendations

### Phase 7.3: After Chatbot Implementation (~2-4 weeks post-launch)
- Build and deploy chatbot
- Let it run for 1-2 weeks to gather usage data
- Then interview Mike about complete site + chatbot
- Create MikeJones.online case study

### Phase 7.4: 1-2 months post-launch
- Add Home Media Server case study
- Provides non-AI project diversity
- Shows infrastructure capabilities

### Phase 7.5: 3+ months post-launch (if desired)
- Evaluate AI Memory System
- Add if valuable
- Or identify different projects to showcase

---

## Why This Approach Works

### Progressive Enhancement
- Launch with strong AI foundation (2 case studies)
- Add meta case study (site itself) next
- Add infrastructure project (Home Media Server) for breadth
- Evaluate additional projects based on feedback

### Quality Over Quantity
- Each case study comprehensive and valuable
- No rush to add everything at once
- Iterate based on what resonates

### Strategic Storytelling
- AI expertise established at launch
- Meta case study shows practical implementation
- Infrastructure project shows versatility
- Portfolio grows thoughtfully over time

---

## Key Takeaway

**The MikeJones.online website case study is brilliant** because:
- ✅ Meta/self-referential (compelling narrative)
- ✅ Shows AI in practical business context
- ✅ Demonstrates RAG architecture
- ✅ Highlights agent coordination
- ✅ Current and relevant (they're viewing it!)

**This should be the first post-launch case study** after the chatbot is implemented.
