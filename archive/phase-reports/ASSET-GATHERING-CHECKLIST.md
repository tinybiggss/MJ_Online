## 📋 ASSET PREPARATION GUIDELINES

### Image Optimization

Once you've gathered assets:

1. **Resize large images:**
   - Headshots: 1000x1000px max
   - Screenshots: 1920px width max
   - Diagrams: 1500px width max

2. **Compress images:**
   - Use TinyPNG.com (free, excellent compression)
   - Or ImageOptim (Mac app)
   - Target: <200KB per image if possible

3. **Naming convention:**
   - Use descriptive names: `ai-memory-architecture.png`
   - Not: `IMG_1234.jpg`
   - Use hyphens, not spaces: `local-llm-dashboard.png`

4. **Formats:**
   - Photos: JPG (better compression for photos)
   - Screenshots/diagrams: PNG (better for text/UI)
   - Logos: SVG if possible, PNG otherwise

## 📤 UPLOAD TO GHOST (Alice Can Help)

Once assets are ready, they need to be uploaded to Ghost Pro:

**Option A: You upload manually**
- Go to: https://mikejones.ghost.io/ghost/
- Navigate to: Settings → Files (or use media library in editor)
- Upload all images
- Note the Ghost URLs for each image

**Option B: Alice uploads**
- Put all optimized images in `/assets/` folder
- Alice will upload to Ghost and track URLs
- This might be easier - let Alice handle the Ghost upload

## ✅ COMPLETION CHECKLIST

Asset gathering complete when:

- [ ] Professional headshot obtained and saved
- [ ] AI Memory System: At least 1 architecture diagram + 2 screenshots
