## Conflicts Identified

### ⚠️ CRITICAL CONFLICT: Career Length

**Old entry:** rag-2026-01-30-080
- States: "29 years of industry expertise"
- Source: "Velocity-Partners-web-v1.pdf + user correction"

**New entries:** rag-2026-02-13-112
- States: "26+ years in technology (as of 2026)"
- Source: Both resume documents (ATS Optimized + AI Resume Final)

**RESOLUTION REQUIRED:**
Both resume documents consistently state "26+ years" as of 2026. The resumes are the authoritative sources. The "29 years" claim in rag-2026-01-30-080 appears to be incorrect.

**Recommended action:**
- Update rag-2026-01-30-080 or deprecate it
- Use "26+ years" as the verified fact going forward
- Note: Microsoft employment started 1999, which would be ~27 years by 2026, consistent with "26+ years"
