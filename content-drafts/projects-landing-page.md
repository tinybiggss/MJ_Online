# Projects

Building systems that work: AI infrastructure for personal productivity, self-hosted LLM setups for data sovereignty, and community tools that bring neighbors together.

These projects demonstrate **hands-on implementation skills** across AI, infrastructure, and community product design.

---

## Featured Projects

### AI Memory System
**Cross-Platform Knowledge Management**

Personal knowledge management infrastructure that solves the "context loss" problem where each new AI session starts fresh. JSONL ledger maintaining persistent context across Claude, ChatGPT, and local LLMs.

**Problem:** Re-explaining context every new AI session
**Solution:** Structured memory ledger readable by all AI platforms
**Impact:** True cross-platform AI continuity

**Tech:** JSONL, MCP, Cross-platform (Claude/ChatGPT/OpenWebUI)

### Local LLM Setup
**Self-Hosted AI Infrastructure**

Self-hosted AI infrastructure running on Mac Mini providing private, offline capabilities without cloud dependencies. Ollama, Qwen 2.5:14B, OpenWebUI, automated startup, RAG integration.

**Problem:** Cloud AI dependency, privacy concerns, subscription lock-in
**Solution:** Local-first AI stack with complete data sovereignty
**Impact:** $0/month AI, 100% privacy, offline capability

**Tech:** Ollama, Qwen 2.5:14B, OpenWebUI, macOS LaunchAgents, RAG

### NeighborhoodShare
**Community Tool-Sharing Platform**

Tool-sharing platform using AI to connect neighbors and build hyperlocal community. Photograph items, AI categorizes automatically, borrow via SMS.

**Problem:** Isolated communities, idle resources, repeated tool purchases
**Solution:** Low-friction tool sharing with AI categorization
**Impact:** Building community through practical mutual aid

**Tech:** AI Categorization, Geolocation, SMS Notifications

## The Through-Line: Building Better Systems

Across 29 years, my career has one consistent thread: **creating better systems**.

These projects continue that pattern:
- **AI Memory System:** Systems for maintaining context
- **Local LLM Setup:** Infrastructure for data sovereignty
- **NeighborhoodShare:** Platforms for community connection

It's not systems for systems' sake—it's always **people-centered**: solving real problems, reducing friction, enabling better outcomes.

## Connection to the 7 Pillars

These projects implement my [7 Pillars framework](https://resilienttomorrow.substack.com) for building parallel systems:

**Pillar 3 (Access > Money):**
NeighborhoodShare reduces spending while increasing access. Wealth redefined as **access to resources**, not ownership.

**Pillar 4 (Knowledge Stewardship):**
AI Memory System and Local LLM Setup demonstrate **systems that don't require permission**. Knowledge infrastructure you control.

**Pillar 5 (Communication Independence):**
Local LLM provides **AI that works for you, not on you**. Complete data sovereignty and offline capability.

**Pillar 7 (Hyperlocal Community):**
NeighborhoodShare builds **relationships within walking distance**. Your immediate neighbors are your most important network.

---

## Why These Projects Matter

**For AI Implementation:**
These projects demonstrate practical AI infrastructure skills: cross-platform integration, self-hosted deployment, RAG systems, context engineering, local-first architecture.

**For Community Resilience:**
Looking ahead 5-10 years, I anticipate harder times. These projects test ideas for **mutual aid, data sovereignty, and hyperlocal support systems**.

**For Me:**
I'm building the world I want to live in. A world where neighbors help each other, where AI works for people (not corporations), where access matters more than money, where community isn't just a buzzword—it's infrastructure.

## Publishing Options

### Option 1: Static Page (Recommended for MVP)

**Steps:**
1. Create new page in Ghost Admin → Pages → New Page
2. Set title: "Projects - Mike Jones"
3. Paste content above into Ghost editor
4. Set URL slug to "/projects"
5. Add featured image (optional)
6. Set excerpt and meta description
7. Publish page

**Pros:** Simple, full control over layout and copy
**Cons:** Manual updates when adding new projects

---

### Option 2: Ghost Collections (Dynamic)

**Steps:**
1. In Ghost Admin, go to Settings → Design → Collections
2. Create "Projects" collection
3. Filter: Posts tagged with "Projects" or "Featured"
4. Choose display style (grid, list, featured)
5. Customize collection page URL to "/projects"

**Pros:** Automatically displays new posts tagged "Projects", dynamic updates
**Cons:** Less control over custom copy and layout

---

### Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

**Best of both:**
1. Create static page at "/projects" (full control over intro copy)
2. Use Ghost Collections at bottom to auto-display project posts
3. Manual featured section at top, dynamic feed below

This gives control over messaging while keeping content fresh automatically.
