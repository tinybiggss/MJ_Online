### I Build Systems That Help People Thrive

For 29 years, I've created better systems—from Xbox instrumentation tools to AI-augmented workflows for gaming studios. I see where work flows and where it doesn't, then build systems that make things work.

## What I Do

I run **Velocity Partners**, combining program management expertise with AI implementation to help gaming, entertainment, and media companies build organizational muscle for repeatable delivery.

**Tagline:** Make Work Flow

My signature methodology—**AI-Augmented Process Design (AAPD)**—treats AI as an execution multiplier that only works when the underlying process is sound.

**Core principle:** "The fastest way to waste money on AI is to automate a broken workflow. The fastest way to create leverage is to design the process first—then deploy agents where friction actually lives."

## Featured Projects

### AI Memory System

Personal knowledge management infrastructure that maintains context across AI conversations and platforms. Solves the "context loss" problem where each new AI session starts fresh with no memory of previous work.

Uses a structured JSONL ledger that both humans and AI can read/write, enabling continuous project context across Claude, ChatGPT, and local AI (OpenWebUI/Ollama).

**Impact:** Demonstrates practical AI implementation skills and enables persistent context across multiple AI platforms.

### Local LLM Setup

Self-hosted AI infrastructure running on a Mac Mini—private, offline AI capabilities without cloud dependencies. Combines Ollama (running local models like Qwen 2.5:14B), OpenWebUI (ChatGPT-like interface), and MCP bridge (filesystem access).

**Why self-host?** Privacy and sovereignty. My data stays on my machine. Works offline, no subscription dependency, can't be taken away.

**Impact:** Hands-on AI infrastructure expertise. AI "built to work for me, not on me, and to keep my data where it belongs."

### NeighborhoodShare

Tool-sharing platform for local communities. Why buy a ladder you'll use twice a year when your neighbor has one sitting in their garage?

Builds local relationships through resource sharing. Part of the **7 Pillars of Resilience** framework—building parallel systems that reduce dependency on fragile centralized infrastructure.

**Impact:** Implements Pillar 3 (Access > Money) and Pillar 7 (Hyperlocal Community).
