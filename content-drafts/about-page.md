## I Build Systems That Help People Thrive

For 29 years, I've had one consistent mission: creating better systems. Whether I'm optimizing workflows at a warehouse, building instrumentation tools for Xbox developers, or implementing AI-augmented processes for gaming studios, the pattern is the same—I see where work flows and where it doesn't, then I build the systems that make things work.

Today, I run **Velocity Partners**, a consulting practice that combines program management expertise with AI implementation. I help gaming, entertainment, and media companies (50-1500 person teams) build organizational muscle for repeatable delivery through my **AI-Augmented Process Design (AAPD)** methodology.

## The Origin Story

My path to tech started with a childhood dream of making video games. At 10 years old, I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

In college, I studied political science—not because I wanted to be a politician, but because I was fascinated by *systems*: how projects move through processes, how laws pass, how society is governed. I was always asking, "How does this actually work?"

The pivot came accidentally. My roommate was studying for Microsoft networking certification in the early 1990s. As we talked through concepts, I realized I understood the material better than he did—I could see how the processes and projects worked together. I applied this knowledge to hack my college network for multiplayer Doom sessions (1990-91).

After graduating, I joined **Aviation Supplies & Academics** doing tech support and QA for flight simulator software. That's when I realized: my passion was software, not politics. I enrolled at the University of Washington for computer science, met someone working at Microsoft Games, and within six weeks, I had my dream job at the Microsoft Games Organization.

## The Through-Line: Creating Better Systems

This started even before tech. As a college warehouse manager for a plumbing distributor, I optimized inflow/outflow workflows. My manager constantly told me, "You're so efficient!"

At **Microsoft** (1999-2005), I created the **VINCE instrumentation tool**—an Xbox SDK method for organizing and visualizing video game data. It made player struggle data visible, transforming subjective developer feedback into evidence they couldn't ignore. I hold a patent for this work. I also contributed to the **Xbox and Xbox 360 launch teams**, working on 6 AAA titles.

At **Oberon Media/iPlay**, I streamlined content delivery to web. At **Platum**, I came in early and defined processes and delivery methods. At **Kabam** (during hypergrowth), I started managing departments, then kept acquiring more by identifying gaps and showing, "This is how we should do this work." I established workflows for distributed teams building top-grossing games.

The pattern repeated at **Livescribe**, **Kinoo**, and **8 Circuit Studios** (a Web3 gaming company I co-founded). It's never systems for systems' sake—it's always people-centered: hearing problems, filling gaps, and creating career opportunities for the people I work with.

**Career achievements across 29 years:**
- 80% improvement in delivery predictability
- 3x operational efficiency gains
- Managed teams of 50-120+ people
- Managed budgets of $4M-$12M+

## The AI Transition: From Systems Guy to AI Builder

About 2.5 years ago, I discovered AI could take my big ideas and make them actionable.

As a systems thinker, I've always seen connections and dots that others couldn't follow when I tried to explain them. AI provided structure—it helped me create a "straight line" for others to see what I saw. This enabled **Resilient Tomorrow**, my Substack publication on community resilience, where AI helped organize my thoughts into meaningful frameworks like my **7 Pillars of Personal Resilience**.

According to my 2025 ChatGPT year-in-review report, I'm in the **top 1% of ChatGPT users** and **top 3% for conversation volume**. I quickly mastered prompting, but realized the real key is **context**: give AI the right context and it can help you find answers. Once I saw AI could help me code, build prototypes, and create things I wanted to see in the world—there was no stopping it.

## Current Work: Velocity Partners

**Velocity Partners** is my consulting practice—a division of **Jones Collaboration Company, LLC**. We provide AI-augmented PMO solutions for gaming, entertainment, and media companies.

**Tagline:** *Make Work Flow*

### AI-Augmented Process Design (AAPD)

AAPD is my signature methodology that treats AI as an execution multiplier—one that only works when the underlying process is sound.

**Core principle:** *"The fastest way to waste money on AI is to automate a broken workflow. The fastest way to create leverage is to design the process first—then deploy agents where friction actually lives."*

**Three core principles:**

1. **Design Before Delegation** - Don't ask AI to "build me a system." Design the system first (requirements, workflows, ownership, constraints), then delegate execution where friction lives.

2. **Orchestration Beats Replacement** - No single tool does everything. With clear handoffs, AI tools orchestrate work across boundaries that normally require meetings, tickets, and manual coordination. AI creates leverage not by replacing people or tools, but by amplifying them.

3. **Test Small, Then Scale** - Low-stakes tests expose instruction gaps and tool limits early when they're cheap to fix. Iteration isn't hesitation, it's control. Failures scale as fast as successes.

### Services

I offer three engagement models:
- **Workflow Assessment** ($4k-$12k one-time): Identify bottlenecks, map current state, design future state
- **Embedded Execution** ($8k-$18k/month retainer): Hands-on implementation alongside your team
- **Full PMO Build** ($15k-$25k+/month): Complete organizational muscle development

**Sweet spot clients:** Organizations that have outgrown startup improvisation but haven't built organizational muscle for repeatable delivery.

## Projects: Building Systems I Want to See in the World

My personal projects implement my **7 Pillars of Resilience** framework—building parallel systems that reduce dependency on fragile centralized infrastructure while still living in the world as it is.

### AI Memory System (OfflineAI)

A personal knowledge management infrastructure that maintains context across AI conversations and platforms. It solves the problem of "context loss"—where each new AI session starts fresh with no memory of previous work.

The system uses a structured JSONL ledger that both humans and AI can read/write, enabling continuous project context across Claude, ChatGPT, and local AI (OpenWebUI/Ollama).

**Implements:** Pillar 4 (Knowledge Stewardship) and Pillar 5 (Communication Independence)

### Local LLM Setup (OfflineAI)

Self-hosted AI infrastructure running on a Mac Mini that provides private, offline AI capabilities. It combines Ollama (for running local models like Qwen 2.5:14B), OpenWebUI (for a ChatGPT-like interface), and an MCP bridge (for filesystem access).

**Why self-host?** Privacy and sovereignty. My data stays on my machine—no one else has access. The system works without internet, has no subscription dependency, and can't be taken away. As I write: AI "built to work for me, not on me, and to keep my data where it belongs."

**Implements:** Pillar 4 (Knowledge Stewardship) and Pillar 5 (Communication Independence)

### NeighborhoodShare

A tool-sharing platform for local communities. Why buy a ladder you'll use twice a year when your neighbor has one sitting in their garage? NeighborhoodShare builds local relationships through resource sharing.

**Implements:** Pillar 3 (Access > Money) and Pillar 7 (Hyperlocal Community)

### Resilient Tomorrow (Substack)

Essays on technology, resilience, and building sustainable systems. The publication explores how to build parallel systems for personal and community resilience in an unstable world.

**7 Pillars of Personal Resilience:**
1. Agency and Autonomy
2. Skills and Competence
3. Access > Money
4. Knowledge Stewardship
5. Communication Independence
6. Adaptive Mindset
7. Hyperlocal Community

## Beyond Work

When I'm not building systems or implementing AI workflows, I'm engaged with community and creative pursuits.

I'm an active participant in the **Burning Man community**, where principles of radical self-reliance and communal effort resonate with my approach to technology and problem-solving.

In 2016, I opened **Insight Float**, a flotation center and spa in Silicon Valley dedicated to sensory deprivation tanks. The venture reflected my desire to serve my community by offering stressed-out tech workers a place to rest, recover, and find meaning. The tanks provide an environment to slow down, think, and understand what they want from life. This wasn't a tech play—it was me applying systems thinking to human wellness.

I'm also passionate about the **creator economy**. My motivation for co-founding 8 Circuit Studios went beyond building a metaverse—I wanted to fix something I'd observed across years in gaming: the people doing the real work (creatives, developers, QA testers working 60-hour weeks through crunch) rarely saw significant returns even on successful products. Web3 offered an opportunity to track asset ownership on blockchain so that every transaction could be traced back to original creators, giving them ongoing royalties. The vision: a system where the people who make the product are the ones who get rewarded.
