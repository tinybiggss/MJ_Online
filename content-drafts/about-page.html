<h2>The Through-Line: Creating Better Systems</h2>

<p>For 29 years, I've been building systems that help people work better. It started before I even got into tech—as a college warehouse manager, I was optimizing workflow and reducing bottlenecks. At Microsoft, I created the VINCE tool to make player data visible to developers. At every company since, I've identified gaps, created systems, and opened career opportunities for the people I work with.</p>

<p>It's always been people-centered. I hear the problems teams are facing, fill the gaps, and create systems that help people thrive. That's the through-line of my career.</p>

<h2>From Political Science to Xbox: An Accidental Path to Tech</h2>

<p>Between ages 10-14, I had one dream: make video games. Then I went to college and pivoted hard into political science. Not because I wanted to be in politics—I was fascinated by systems. How do projects move through processes? How do laws pass? How is society governed? I loved understanding how the pieces fit together.</p>

<p>The tech pivot happened by accident. My roommate was studying for a Microsoft networking certification, and I realized I understood the material better than he did. I could see how the processes and projects worked together. Around the same time, I hacked the college network to play multiplayer Doom (this was 1990-91, when that wasn't common).</p>

<p>After graduation, I worked at Aviation Supplies & Academics doing tech support and QA for flight simulator software. I realized my passion was software, not politics. So I enrolled at the University of Washington for computer science, met someone at Microsoft Games, and within six weeks, I had my dream job at the Microsoft Games Organization. That was 1999.</p>

<h2>Career Highlights</h2>

<p>Over 29 years, I've worked across gaming, entertainment, media, and tech—always focused on creating systems that help people thrive.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Microsoft (1999-2007):</strong> Xbox & Xbox 360 launch teams, contributed to 6 AAA titles. Created VINCE instrumentation tool (Xbox SDK patent) that evolved into Halo's Kill Cam feature</li>
  <li><strong>Director Roles (2008-2021):</strong> Led PMO and production teams at Kabam (hypergrowth gaming), Livescribe (digital pen systems), Kinoo (AR communication platform - 10 awards including CES Innovation Award)</li>
  <li><strong>8 Circuit Studios (2022-2024):</strong> Co-founder of Web3 gaming company building "proto-metaverse" with player ownership and creator royalties</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Managed teams of 50-120+ people, budgets $4M-$12M+. Achieved 80% improvement in delivery predictability, 3x operational efficiency gains</li>
</ul>

<h2>The AI Transition: From Systems Guy to AI Builder</h2>

<p>I started working with AI about 2.5 years ago. According to ChatGPT's 2025 year-in-review report, I'm in the top 1% of users and top 3% for conversation volume.</p>

<p>AI clicked for me immediately because I'm a systems thinker. I've always seen connections others couldn't follow. AI gave me structure to create "straight lines" so others could see what I was seeing. It enabled Resilient Tomorrow, where AI helped me organize my thoughts into meaningful conversations.</p>

<p>I quickly mastered prompting, but I realized the real key is context—give AI the right context and it can help you find answers. Once I saw that AI could help me code, build prototypes, and create things I wanted to see in the world, there was no stopping it.</p>

<p>Now I'm not just using AI systems—I'm building them. I've created an AI Memory System for persistent context, set up local LLM infrastructure for privacy, and developed the AI-Augmented Process Design (AAPD) methodology for my clients.</p>

<h2>Current Work</h2>

<p>Today I'm working on parallel projects that all implement the same vision—building systems that reduce dependency and give people more agency.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Velocity Partners:</strong> AI-augmented PMO consulting for gaming, entertainment, and media companies with 50-1500 person teams. Using the AAPD methodology and PM Drowning framework to provide fractional PMO services. Making work flow.</li>
  <li><strong>NeighborhoodShare:</strong> Tool-sharing platform that uses AI to categorize items, building hyperlocal community through mutual aid. Started with an angle grinder story—solving problems with resources already around us.</li>
  <li><strong>AI Memory System:</strong> Personal knowledge management infrastructure that maintains context across AI conversations and platforms. JSONL format, cross-AI compatible (Claude, ChatGPT, OpenWebUI). Solves the context loss problem.</li>
  <li><strong>Local LLM Infrastructure:</strong> Self-hosted AI running on a Mac Mini (Ollama + OpenWebUI). Privacy, sovereignty, offline capability. AI built to work for me, not on me.</li>
  <li><strong>Resilient Tomorrow:</strong> Substack publication on community resilience and building parallel systems. Features the 7 Pillars framework. Top articles have reached 989 likes and 230 restacks. Includes the Offramp Assistant GPT and Community Defense Playbook.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It All Connects</h2>

<p>All these projects implement the 7 Pillars framework from Resilient Tomorrow—building parallel systems that reduce dependency on fragile centralized infrastructure.</p>

<p>Here are the specific connections: NeighborhoodShare embodies Pillar 3 (Access > Money) and Pillar 7 (Hyperlocal Community). The AI Memory System and Local LLM infrastructure support Pillar 4 (Knowledge Stewardship) and Pillar 5 (Communication Independence). Resilient Tomorrow is the thesis tying it all together.</p>

<p>My core philosophy: "You don't burn the old system down until the new one can carry weight." I'm building in parallel while still living in the world as it is.</p>

<h2>What Drives Me</h2>

<p>Creating efficiency and better systems has been consistent since my college warehouse days. I've always been driven to make things work better.</p>

<p>But it's always people-centered. I hear what teams are struggling with, fill the gaps, and create opportunities for people to grow. It's not about individual mastery—it's about shared capability.</p>

<p>It's not about purity, it's about direction. Building systems that help people thrive.</p>

<h2>Let's Talk</h2>

<p>Whether you're looking to implement AI in your organization, need help untangling complex workflows, or want to explore collaboration—I'd love to hear from you.</p>
