<h2>Who I Am</h2>
<p>I didn't start in tech. I studied political science because I was fascinated by SYSTEMS—how projects move through processes, how laws pass, how society is governed. That systems thinking led me from Xbox launch teams to building AI infrastructure today.</p>
<p>Now I build AI systems that give people more agency and reduce dependency on fragile centralized infrastructure. Whether it's helping teams ship better products or building tools for hyperlocal community, it's always about creating systems that help people thrive.</p>
