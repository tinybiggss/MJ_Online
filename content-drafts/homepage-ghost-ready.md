## Overview

For nearly three decades, I've been creating systems that make work visible, reduce meeting overhead, and help teams deliver.

- **AI Infrastructure Implementation**—from organizational memory systems to local LLM deployments
- **Practical AI Integration**—top 1% ChatGPT user, building tools that actually solve real problems

**Career Highlights:**

- Xbox launch team member and SDK patent holder (VINCE instrumentation tool)
- Director-level roles at Kabam, Livescribe, and Kinoo
- Co-founder of 8 Circuit Studios (Web3 gaming)
- Managed teams of 50-120+ people, budgets of $4M-$12M+
- 80% improvement in delivery predictability, 3x operational efficiency gains

## Writing & Thinking

I write about two things:

**[Resilient Tomorrow →](https://resilienttomorrow.substack.com)** — Community resilience, organizing, and building parallel systems that work when traditional ones don't. The editorial voice is urgent but grounded, practical over theoretical.

**Organizational Intelligence** — PMO frameworks, process design, and AI-augmented workflows for Velocity Partners clients.

---

## Let's Work Together

**Velocity Partners** offers three service tiers:

1. **Workflow Assessment + Playbook** (2 weeks, $4k-$12k)
2. **Implementation Sprint** (3 weeks, $8k-$25k)
3. **Fractional PMO Retainer** (ongoing, $6k-$18k/month)

Ideal for teams of 50-500 in gaming, entertainment, or media who are stuck in "too many meetings, still no clarity."
