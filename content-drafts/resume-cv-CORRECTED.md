## Professional Summary

Organizational intelligence architect with **29 years of experience** building systems that help people thrive. I combine program management expertise with AI implementation to help gaming, entertainment, and media companies build organizational muscle for repeatable delivery.

I created the **AI-Augmented Process Design (AAPD)** methodology—treating AI as an execution multiplier that only works when the underlying process is sound. My approach: design the process first, then deploy AI agents where friction actually lives.

**Not seeking employment—I run Velocity Partners.** But if you need someone who can design the process first, then deploy AI where friction actually lives, let's talk.

## Professional Philosophy

### The Through-Line: Creating Better Systems

Across 29 years, my career has one consistent thread: **creating better systems**. This started before tech—as a college warehouse manager, I optimized workflows and heard "you're so efficient!" constantly.

At Microsoft (1999), I created the VINCE tool to make player struggle data visible. At Verizon: content pipeline from 24 hours to 2 hours. At Kabam: kept acquiring departments by showing "here's how we should do this work." The pattern repeated at every company.

**It's not systems for systems' sake—it's always people-centered:** hearing problems, filling gaps, and creating career opportunities for the people I work with.

### AI-Augmented Process Design (AAPD)

My signature methodology treats AI as an execution multiplier—one that only works when the underlying process is sound.

**Core principle:** "The fastest way to waste money on AI is to automate a broken workflow. The fastest way to create leverage is to design the process first—then deploy agents where friction actually lives."

**Three core principles:**
1. **Design Before Delegation** - Design the system first, then delegate execution
2. **Orchestration Beats Replacement** - AI creates leverage by amplifying people and tools, not replacing them
3. **Test Small, Then Scale** - Low-stakes tests expose gaps early when they're cheap to fix

### Leadership Style

I describe myself as a **"player-coach"**—maintaining solid understanding so I can get hands dirty when needed, ask knowledgeable questions, and make good estimations.

I excel at identifying people's strengths (sometimes before they recognize them themselves), helping them see their value, and coaching them to grow. I believe in creating environments where teams communicate, collaborate, and connect.

**Risk management:** I maintain risk registers reviewed before EVERY meeting including standups. If risks aren't kept front-and-center, they escalate from risks into issues.
