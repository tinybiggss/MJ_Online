# About Mike Jones

## Introduction

I'm Mike Jones, an AI engineer and developer focused on building practical AI/ML solutions and self-hosted infrastructure. My work centers on implementing real-world AI applications, from LLM integration and prompt engineering to automated workflows and local model deployment. I'm driven by the potential of AI to transform how we work and solve problems, and I believe in learning through hands-on implementation.

## Professional Journey

My career in technology has evolved through diverse roles in software development, web applications, and system architecture. Over the past several years, I've deliberately shifted my focus toward artificial intelligence and machine learning, recognizing that practical AI implementation skills are essential for modern software development.

This transition has been marked by deep, hands-on exploration of AI/ML technologies. Rather than just following tutorials or taking courses, I've built production-ready systems, experimented with self-hosted AI infrastructure, and developed real solutions to actual problems. Each project has expanded my understanding of what's possible with AI and how to implement these capabilities effectively.

My approach emphasizes practical application over theoretical knowledge. I've learned that the gap between understanding an AI concept and successfully implementing it in production is significant. My professional journey has been about bridging that gap through systematic experimentation, documentation, and iterative improvement.

## Current Focus

Today, my work centers on several key areas of AI/ML implementation:

**LLM Integration & Workflow Automation**: I build systems that leverage large language models to automate complex workflows, process information at scale, and augment human decision-making. This includes prompt engineering, context management, and designing robust LLM-powered applications.

**Self-Hosted AI Infrastructure**: I'm passionate about running AI systems on local hardware, giving organizations control over their data and models. My projects include deploying local LLMs, building custom inference servers, and optimizing model performance for edge deployment.

**Practical AI Application Development**: I focus on AI solutions that solve real business problems. This means understanding requirements, choosing appropriate models and frameworks, and building systems that are maintainable, scalable, and actually useful.

**AI Memory Systems**: One of my key projects involves building sophisticated memory systems for AI agents, enabling them to maintain context, learn from interactions, and provide more intelligent responses over time.

I document my work and share insights through case studies and technical writing, both on this site and through my SubStack publications. I believe in learning in public and contributing to the broader AI/ML community.

## Beyond Work

When I'm not coding or experimenting with AI systems, I'm engaged with community and creative pursuits. I'm an active participant in the Burning Man community, where principles of radical self-reliance and communal effort resonate with my approach to technology and problem-solving.

I believe in continuous learning, sharing knowledge openly, and building systems that empower people. Whether I'm writing technical documentation, contributing to open-source projects, or helping others learn about AI, I'm committed to making technology more accessible and useful.
