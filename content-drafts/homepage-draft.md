## Featured Projects Section

### AI Memory System
A personal knowledge management infrastructure that maintains context across AI conversations and platforms. Solves the "context loss" problem where each new AI session starts fresh.

**Tech:** JSONL ledger, cross-platform (Claude, ChatGPT, OpenWebUI), MCP integration

### Local LLM Infrastructure
Self-hosted AI infrastructure running on Mac Mini—private, offline AI capabilities with Ollama, OpenWebUI, and automated startup.

**Tech:** Qwen 2.5:14B, macOS LaunchAgents, RAG knowledge base integration

## Writing & Thinking

I write about two things:

**[Resilient Tomorrow](https://resilienttomorrow.substack.com)** — Community resilience, organizing, and building parallel systems that work when traditional ones don't. The editorial voice is urgent but grounded, practical over theoretical.

**Organizational Intelligence** — PMO frameworks, process design, and AI-augmented workflows for Velocity Partners clients.

## Let's Work Together

**Velocity Partners** offers three service tiers:
1. **Workflow Assessment + Playbook** (2 weeks, $4k-$12k)
2. **Implementation Sprint** (3 weeks, $8k-$25k)
3. **Fractional PMO Retainer** (ongoing, $6k-$18k/month)

Ideal for teams of 50-500 in gaming, entertainment, or media who are stuck in "too many meetings, still no clarity."
