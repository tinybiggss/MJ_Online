# Project Memory - NeighborhoodShare

## Project Overview
- **Name**: NeighborhoodShare - Community Operating System
- **Status**: Active (Major pivot in progress)
- **Created**: 2025-01-17
- **Description**: Community coordination platform focused on events and project coordination rather than tool sharing
- **Goals**: Create sustainable neighborhood operating system for sharing, connecting, and co-investing

## Key Context
- **Background**: Originally started as tool-sharing platform, pivoted to community-first approach after validation showed insufficient engagement
- **Stakeholders**: Local neighborhood residents, solar project participants, broader Resilient Tomorrow ecosystem
- **Constraints**: Technical complexity of customization, community engagement sustainability, revenue model without extraction
- **Dependencies**: Solar installation project success, Mobilizon technical evaluation

## Current State
- **Progress**: Tool sharing MVP validated (failed), strategic pivot to community OS approach decided
- **Active Tasks**: 
  - Evaluate Mobilizon as technical foundation
  - Design neighborhood verification system
  - Plan community-specific features
- **Blockers**: None currently identified
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. Complete Mobilizon technical evaluation by 2025-01-31
  2. Design neighborhood verification flows by 2025-02-07
  3. Test platform with solar installation coordination

## Key Decisions & Validation
### Major Decisions
1. **DEC-001**: Pivot from tool-sharing to community-first approach
   - **Rationale**: Tool sharing validation showed 30 signups, 27 tools added by founder, zero repeat usage
   - **Impact**: Complete strategic direction change

2. **DEC-002**: Frame as "neighborhood operating system" infrastructure 
   - **Rationale**: Aligns with NeighborhoodShare vision, positions for ecosystem development
   - **Impact**: Product positioning and architecture direction

3. **DEC-003**: Evaluate Mobilizon as technical foundation
   - **Rationale**: Events-first design matches engagement patterns, built for local communities
   - **Impact**: Technology stack decision

4. **DEC-004**: Reject Web3/tokenization/gamification
   - **Rationale**: Philosophical contradiction, adds complexity, undermines intrinsic motivation
   - **Impact**: Eliminates major technical complexity

### Validated Insights
- Tool sharing has insufficient engagement frequency (High confidence)
- Social connection is the actual unmet need (High confidence)  
- Community projects create natural engagement loops (Medium confidence)
- Neighbors want "Nextdoor before toxic" + "Meetup before commercial"

## Resources
- **Documents**: 
  - Original vision document (location TBD)
  - Memory log: `/Claude/neighborhoodshare_memory_log.txt`
- **Research**: Community platform analysis, Mobilizon evaluation
- **Tools**: Mobilizon (evaluating), existing solar project coordination tools
- **References**: Behavioral psychology research on intrinsic motivation

## Open Questions
1. **Q-001**: Can Mobilizon be customized for neighborhood verification without losing simplicity? (HIGH PRIORITY)
2. **Q-002**: What minimum viable community features drive sustained engagement? (HIGH PRIORITY)
3. **Q-003**: How to balance immediate utility with future investment/governance layers?
4. **Q-004**: What business model can sustain platform without becoming extractive? (HIGH PRIORITY)
5. **Q-005**: How many active participants needed for viable community platform?

## Success Metrics
### Community Engagement
- Real-world projects successfully coordinated
- Neighborhood resident participation percentage
- New relationships/connections formed
- Mutual aid/resource sharing frequency

### Platform Utility
- Time saved vs existing coordination methods
- Community project success rate
- User retention and repeat engagement
- Knowledge sharing and documentation quality

### Business Viability
- Community willingness to pay for features
- Local business partnerships
- Cost per active member
- Path to break-even timeline

## Risk Assessment
- **Community engagement sustainability**: Medium probability, High impact
- **Technical customization complexity**: Medium probability, Medium impact
- **No sustainable revenue model**: High probability, High impact
- **Platform becomes political battleground**: Medium probability, High impact

## Communication
- **Last Discussion**: 2025-01-17 - Major strategic pivot discussion and validation review
- **Questions/Issues**: Need to validate technical feasibility of Mobilizon customization
- **User Preferences**: Community-first design, data dignity, avoid extraction/gamification
