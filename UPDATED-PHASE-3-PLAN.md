# Updated Phase 3 Plan - Case Studies for Launch

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** Ready for Home Media Server interview

---

## ✅ DECISION: Launch Case Study Portfolio

### Case Studies for Initial Launch (3 Total)

**1. NeighborhoodShare - Full-Stack Development + AI Integration** ✅
- **Status:** Ted complete (2,826 lines), Alice queued
- **Showcases:** Full-stack development, AI integration (GPT-4o Vision), state machine, multi-service integration
- **Target audience:** Employers seeking full-stack developers with AI capabilities
- **RAG entries:** 10 verified entries

**2. Local LLM Setup - AI Infrastructure** ✅
- **Status:** Ted complete (1,705 lines + 13 RAG entries), Alice queued
- **Showcases:** AI infrastructure deployment, MCP integration, production-grade auto-start, RAG implementation
- **Target audience:** Employers seeking AI infrastructure specialists
- **RAG entries:** 13 verified entries

**3. Home Media Server - Infrastructure & Systems Administration** ⚪ READY FOR INTERVIEW
- **Status:** Ready for Ted interview NOW
- **Showcases:** Self-hosting, infrastructure management, systems administration, privacy-first approach, cost-benefit analysis
- **Target audience:** Employers seeking infrastructure/systems capabilities
- **Differentiator:** Non-AI project showing breadth of technical expertise

---

## ⏸️ DEFERRED: Post-Launch

**AI Memory System** - Deferred to Phase 7 (Post-Launch Enhancements)
- **Reason:** Local LLM already covers memory systems and AI infrastructure
- **Decision:** Would be somewhat redundant with Local LLM case study
- **Can add later:** If desired to showcase cross-platform memory (ChatGPT + Claude)

---

## 🎯 Why This Portfolio Works

### Demonstrates Breadth
- **AI expertise:** 2 AI projects (NeighborhoodShare AI integration, Local LLM infrastructure)
- **Full-stack:** NeighborhoodShare (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AI services)
- **Infrastructure:** Local LLM + Home Media Server (self-hosting, systems admin)
- **Diversity:** AI projects + practical infrastructure work

### Quality Over Quantity
- Each case study is comprehensive and well-documented
- Real technical depth from Ted's structured interviews
- Verified facts in RAG knowledge base
- Honest assessments (what worked, what didn't)

### Employer Value
- Multiple skill areas demonstrated
- Different types of projects (product, infrastructure, AI)
- Shows decision-making, cost-benefit analysis, technical execution
- Real-world outcomes and metrics
