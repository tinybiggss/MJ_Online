# Task #1: Homepage Empty Sections - Analysis & Solution

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** Investigation Complete - Manual Fix Required
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Blocking Launch)
**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes

---

## Executive Summary

The homepage displays **3 empty sections** that are auto-generated by the Kyoto theme, not part of the custom page content. These sections need to be disabled through Ghost Admin UI theme settings.

**Empty Sections Found:**
1. ✅ **"Creating"** - Empty (CSS class: `section-personal-project`)
2. ✅ **"Case studies"** - Empty (CSS class: `section-case-study`)
3. ✅ **"Testimonials"** - Empty (CSS class: `section-testimonials`)

**Working Sections:**
- ✅ **Custom Page Content** - Your Mike Jones intro, Featured Work, etc. (ALL GOOD)
- ✅ **"Thoughts"** - Blog posts section (CSS class: `section-blog`) - WORKING

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Homepage Has Two Layers:

**Layer 1: Custom Page (`/pages/slug/home`)**
This is the page you edit in Ghost editor. Contains:
- H1: Mike Jones
- Tagline: AI Implementation Expert and LLM Integration Specialist
- Intro paragraph (29 years...)
- Featured Work section with 3 projects
- Who I Am section
- Core Expertise section
- Let's Work Together section

✅ **This content is PERFECT - no changes needed**

**Layer 2: Kyoto Theme Auto-Sections**
The Kyoto theme automatically injects these sections around your custom content:
- Section: "Creating" (looks for posts tagged `#Creating` or `#Personal Project`)
- Section: "Thoughts" (shows blog posts) - ✅ WORKS
- Section: "Case studies" (looks for posts tagged `#Case Study`)
- Section: "Testimonials" (looks for testimonial posts)

❌ **Problem: 3 of these auto-sections are empty**

---

## Why Are They Empty?

### "Creating" Section
- **Looking for:** Posts tagged with `#Creating` or `#Personal Project`
- **What we have:** Posts tagged with `#Projects` (not matching)
- **Result:** Empty section displays

### "Case studies" Section
- **Looking for:** Posts tagged with `#Case Study` (singular, exact match)
- **What we have:** Posts tagged with `#Projects`, `#Featured`, `#AI`, etc.
- **Result:** Empty section (theme can't find matching posts)

### "Testimonials" Section
- **Looking for:** Posts or pages tagged with `#Testimonials`
- **What we have:** No testimonial content yet
- **Result:** Empty section displays

### "Thoughts" Section ✅
- **Looking for:** Blog posts (any posts not in other categories)
- **What we have:** Several published posts
- **Result:** Section works correctly!

## Solution Options

### ⭐ Option 1: Disable Empty Sections (RECOMMENDED)

**Access Ghost Admin UI:**
1. Go to https://mikejones-online.ghost.io/ghost/
2. Navigate to: **Settings → Design**
3. Look for **"Site-wide"** or **"Homepage"** tab
4. Find **"Homepage Sections"** settings

**Disable these sections:**
- [ ] Toggle OFF: "Creating" / "Personal Projects"
- [ ] Toggle OFF: "Case studies" / "Case Studies"
- [ ] Toggle OFF: "Testimonials"
- [x] Keep ON: "Thoughts" / "Blog Posts"

**Save changes and verify:** https://www.mikejones.online/

**Why this is best:**
- Quick fix (5 minutes)
- Your custom "Featured Work" already showcases projects beautifully
- No content duplication
- Clean, professional homepage

---

### Option 2: Tag Posts to Populate Sections

If you want the "Case studies" section to work:

**For each case study post:**
1. Go to **Posts** in Ghost Admin
2. Edit: "AI Memory System", "Local LLM Setup", "NeighborhoodShare"
3. Add tag: `#Case Study` (exact spelling, singular)
4. Toggle: "Featured post" → ON
5. Save

**Result:** "Case studies" section will display cards

**Downside:** Creates duplication (you already have Featured Work section with same projects)

---

### Option 3: Custom CSS to Hide Sections (Quick Hack)

If you can't find theme settings, use custom CSS to hide empty sections:

**Path:** Settings → Design → Site-wide → Advanced → Site header (code injection)

```html
<style>
/* Hide empty homepage sections */
.section-personal-project,
.section-case-study,
.section-testimonials {
    display: none !important;
}
</style>
```

**Paste this in the "Site Header" code injection box**

**Pros:** Immediate fix, no theme settings needed
**Cons:** Sections still load (just hidden), not as clean as proper configuration

---

### Option 4: Custom Routes (Advanced)

Create a custom route that bypasses theme sections:

**Path:** Settings → Labs → Routes

Upload `routes.yaml`:
```yaml
routes:
  /:
    template: home
    data: page.home

collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /blog/{slug}/
    template: index
```

**This makes Ghost use ONLY your custom page content, no theme auto-sections**

---
