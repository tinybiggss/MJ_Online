# Task #1 Completion Report: Homepage Empty Sections

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Agent:** Debbie (Web Design Agent)
**Status:** Analysis Complete - Fix Instructions Provided
**Time Spent:** 45 minutes

---

## Task Summary

**Objective:** Fix critical homepage issues from QA audit:
1. Case Studies section - missing content
2. Empty "Creating" section
3. Empty "Testimonials" section

---

## Investigation Results

### Root Cause Identified

The empty sections are NOT in the custom page content. They are **auto-generated by the Kyoto theme** based on post tags.

**Custom Homepage Page (`/pages/home`):**
- ✅ ALL content is GOOD
- ✅ Mike Jones intro, Featured Work, Who I Am sections are perfect
- ✅ 3 featured project cards display correctly
- ✅ No changes needed to page content

**Kyoto Theme Auto-Sections:**
- ❌ "Creating" section - Empty (looks for `#Creating` tag, finds none)
- ❌ "Case studies" section - Empty (looks for `#Case Study` tag, finds none)
- ❌ "Testimonials" section - Empty (looks for `#Testimonials` tag, finds none)
- ✅ "Thoughts" section - Working (shows blog posts correctly)

### Why Sections Are Empty

**Ghost has 5 posts tagged `#Projects` + `#Featured`:**
1. Local LLM Infrastructure
2. NeighborhoodShare (2 versions)
3. Local LLM Setup
4. AI Memory System

**Problem:** Kyoto theme's "Case studies" section looks for tag `#Case Study` (singular), not `#Projects`.

**Result:** Section displays but has no content to show.

## Solution Provided

Created **3 fix documents** for Mike to implement:

### 1. QUICK-FIX-HOMEPAGE.md ⭐
- **5-minute CSS solution** (immediate fix)
- Paste CSS in Ghost Admin → Settings → Design → Code Injection
- Hides empty sections with `display: none !important`
- **Recommended for fastest launch**

### 2. HOMEPAGE-FIX-GUIDE.md
- **Comprehensive guide** (15-20 minutes)
- Multiple solution options
- Theme settings approach (cleanest but requires finding settings)
- Alternative methods (routes, custom templates)
- **Best for long-term solution**

### 3. TASK-1-HOMEPAGE-EMPTY-SECTIONS-SOLUTION.md
- **Technical analysis document**
- Root cause explanation
- All solution options detailed
- Verification checklist
- **For understanding the issue deeply**

---

## Recommended Action

**FASTEST PATH TO LAUNCH:**

1. Use **QUICK-FIX-HOMEPAGE.md** CSS solution (5 minutes)
2. Verify empty sections are hidden
3. Proceed with launch
4. Optionally: Find theme settings later for cleaner long-term fix

**CSS CODE TO INJECT:**
```html
<style>
/* Hide empty homepage sections */
.section-personal-project,
.section-case-study,
.section-testimonials {
    display: none !important;
}
</style>
```

**WHERE TO PUT IT:**
Ghost Admin → Settings → Design → Site-wide → Advanced → "Site header" code injection

---

## Why Not Fix via API?

Ghost Admin API does **not expose theme settings**. The Kyoto theme's homepage section configuration must be adjusted through:
1. Ghost Admin UI (Settings → Design)
2. Custom CSS injection (code injection)
3. Custom routes.yaml (advanced)

**Cannot be automated** via Python/API scripts.

---

## Verification Steps for Mike

After applying CSS fix:

```bash
# 1. Log into Ghost Admin
https://mikejones-online.ghost.io/ghost/

# 2. Navigate to code injection
Settings → Design → Site-wide → Advanced

# 3. Paste CSS in "Site header" section

# 4. Save changes

# 5. Verify fix
Open: https://www.mikejones.online/
Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R

# 6. Check results
✅ No "Creating" section
✅ No "Case studies" section
✅ No "Testimonials" section
✅ Featured Work still displays
✅ Thoughts section still works
```

---

## What's Still Good (No Changes Needed)

The custom page content is **excellent quality:**

- ✅ Professional headline and tagline
- ✅ Clear value proposition (29 years, AI expertise, AAPD)
- ✅ Three well-presented project cards:
  - NeighborhoodShare (with image and case study link)
  - Local LLM Setup (with architecture diagram)
  - Velocity Partners (with logo)
- ✅ "Who I Am" story section
- ✅ "Core Expertise" bulleted list
- ✅ "Let's Work Together" CTA with contact links
- ✅ Newsletter signup integration
- ✅ Mobile responsive design

**The content itself is portfolio-quality.** Only issue is theme adding empty sections around it.
