# 🔧 Quick Fix: Homepage Empty Sections

**Time:** 5 minutes | **Priority:** CRITICAL

## The Problem

Homepage shows 3 empty sections:
- "Creating" (no content)
- "Case studies" (no content)
- "Testimonials" (no content)

These are auto-generated by Kyoto theme, not part of your page content.

## Alternative: Theme Settings (If Available)

If you prefer to disable via theme settings:

1. Go to: **Settings → Design → Site-wide**
2. Look for **"Homepage Sections"** toggles

4. Save

*(This is cleaner but may not be available in all Kyoto theme versions)*
