Ensures site 'pops' and reflects Mike's AI expertise positioning. Browser automation challenges highlighted need for better process: design system definition → mobiledoc assembly → API-based publishing.",

      "rationale": "ChatGPT suggested separate UXIA (UX/Information Architecture) agent for page structure. Analysis showed: (1) Senior designers already do IA + visual design together (industry standard), (2) Debbie's agent file already includes IA as core responsibility, (3) Design system already constrains choices, (4) Extra agent adds coordination overhead without benefit, (5) PAGE_SPEC (Debbie's output) is what Doc Brown needs anyway. Separating IA from visual design is artificial for this project size (7 pages, 1 designer).",
      "impact": "Simpler workflow (3 agents vs 4), faster execution, clearer ownership. Debbie outputs PAGE_SPEC that includes both IA (section order, visual pacing, density) and design specs (typography, spacing, colors from design system). Clean handoff to Doc Brown for Mobiledoc conversion.",
