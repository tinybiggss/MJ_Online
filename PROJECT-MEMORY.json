    "Agent memory files critical for continuity - agents need to remember work across sessions, track decisions, build expertise",
    "Published content needs quality review - initial pages had factual errors (job titles), missing images, placeholder text",
    "Expert design agents need deep platform knowledge (Ghost/Kyoto) and product understanding (portfolio websites) to make autonomous decisions",
    "Always verify API format compatibility - Ghost Admin API accepted Mobiledoc v0.3.2 with HTTP 200 but didn't apply updates (Ghost 5.x uses Lexical). Silent failures are dangerous.",
    "Simpler solutions often better - HTML with source=html parameter simpler than creating Lexical JSON directly, Ghost converts automatically",
    "Pilot testing essential - Phase 3.0.3 About page pilot test caught critical format incompatibility before affecting all pages",
    "Browser automation has limitations - Ghost editor's iframe structure difficult to automate, need workarounds and API usage",
    "Human-AI collaboration works best when agents are treated as teammates with continuity, respect, and trust - not transactional tools",
    "Agent personalities and names matter - Ted, Alice, Debbie, Morgan have distinct roles and relationships that strengthen collaboration",
