# Homepage Fix Guide - Empty Sections Issue

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Blocking Launch)
**Task:** Remove empty "Creating", "Case studies", and "Testimonials" sections from homepage

---

## Problem Summary

The homepage displays three empty sections generated by the Kyoto theme:
1. **"Creating"** - Empty section with no content
2. **"Case studies"** - Empty section (despite having case study posts)
3. **"Testimonials"** - Empty section with no testimonials

The custom homepage content (Mike Jones intro, Featured Work, etc.) is GOOD. The issue is the theme is auto-generating these additional sections.

---

## Understanding the Issue

**The homepage has TWO parts:**

1. **Custom Page Content** (slug: `home`) - ✅ This is GOOD
   - Mike Jones introduction
   - Featured Work section with 3 projects
   - Who I Am, Core Expertise, Let's Work Together sections

2. **Theme-Generated Sections** - ❌ These are AUTO-ADDED by Kyoto theme
   - "Creating" section (empty)
   - "Case studies" section (empty)
   - "Testimonials" section (empty)
   - "Thoughts" section (works - shows blog posts)

**The empty sections are not in your page editor - they're added by the theme.**

## Solution: Configure Kyoto Theme Homepage Settings

### Step 1: Access Ghost Admin

1. Go to: https://mikejones-online.ghost.io/ghost/
2. Log in with your Ghost admin credentials

### Step 2: Navigate to Design Settings

**Path:** Settings (gear icon) → Design → Site-wide

OR

**Path:** Settings → Theme → Customize

Look for **Homepage Settings** or **Site Sections** configuration.

### Step 3: Find Homepage Section Toggles

The Kyoto theme typically has toggles for homepage sections. Look for:

- [ ] **Creating** section (toggle OFF or remove)
- [ ] **Case studies** section (toggle OFF or fix configuration)
- [ ] **Testimonials** section (toggle OFF)
- [x] **Thoughts** section (keep ON - it's working)

### Step 4: Configure Each Section

**"Creating" Section:**
- **Option A:** Toggle OFF/Disable this section
- **Option B:** If you want to keep it, tag posts with "Creating" to populate it

**"Case studies" Section:**
- **Option A:** Toggle OFF (you already have "Featured Work" with case studies)
- **Option B:** Check what tag/filter it expects:
  - May need "Case Study" tag (not just "Projects")
  - May need posts marked as "Featured"
  - Try applying these to your 3 case study posts

**"Testimonials" Section:**
- **Action:** Toggle OFF (no testimonials collected yet)
- **Future:** Can enable post-launch when testimonials are ready

### Step 5: Save and Preview

1. Click "Save" in design settings
2. Open homepage in new tab: https://www.mikejones.online/
3. Verify empty sections are gone
4. Confirm "Featured Work" custom content still displays correctly

---

## Alternative: Check Theme Documentation

If you can't find homepage section toggles in Settings → Design:

1. Go to: Settings → Theme
2. Click "Download current theme" (to have backup)
3. Look for theme documentation or README
4. Search for "homepage sections" or "featured sections"

**Kyoto theme documentation:** May be in theme files or on theme provider's site

## If Settings Don't Have Toggles: Edit Custom Template

If Kyoto theme doesn't expose section toggles, you may need to:

### Option 1: Use Theme Settings JSON

Some themes allow JSON configuration in Settings → Design → Advanced.

Look for a JSON editor where you can set:
```json
{
  "homepage_sections": {
    "creating": false,
    "case_studies": false,
    "testimonials": false,
    "thoughts": true
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Create Custom Homepage Route

**Path:** Settings → Labs → Beta features → Routes

Upload a custom `routes.yaml` that specifies the homepage:

```yaml
routes:
  /:
    template: home
    data: page.home

collections:
  /posts/:
    permalink: /{slug}/
    template: index
```

This tells Ghost to use ONLY your custom `home` page content, bypassing theme's auto-generated sections.

### Option 3: Custom Theme Template (Advanced)

If you have theme development access:
1. Download current theme (Settings → Theme → Download)
2. Edit `index.hbs` or `home.hbs` template
3. Comment out or remove the loops for empty sections:
   ```handlebars
   {{!-- Disable empty sections
   {{> "loop-creating"}}
   {{> "loop-case-studies"}}
   {{> "loop-testimonials"}}
   --}}
   ```
4. Re-upload modified theme

## Quick Fix: Tag Case Study Posts

If you want the "Case studies" section to WORK instead of hiding it:

1. Go to Posts in Ghost Admin
2. Find your 3 case study posts:
   - AI Memory System
   - Local LLM Setup
   - NeighborhoodShare
3. Edit each post
4. Check if tagged with "Case Study" (not just "Projects")
5. Toggle "Featured post" ON
6. Save

Then the "Case studies" section should populate with cards.

**However:** Since you already have "Featured Work" showcasing these projects, this would create duplication. Recommend disabling the section instead.

## Verification Checklist

After making changes, verify:

- [ ] Homepage loads without empty sections
- [ ] "Featured Work" section still displays 3 projects
- [ ] "Thoughts" section still shows blog posts
- [ ] Newsletter signup still visible
- [ ] Mobile responsive layout still works
- [ ] No console errors (F12 → Console tab)

---

## Summary

**ISSUE:** Kyoto theme auto-generates homepage sections that are empty

**ROOT CAUSE:** Theme configuration, not page content

**FIX:** Disable unused sections in Ghost Design Settings

**TIME:** 10-15 minutes (once you find the right settings)

**RESULT:** Clean homepage with only your custom content + "Thoughts" blog feed

---

## If You Need Help

If you can't find the section toggles in Ghost Admin:

1. **Screenshot** the Settings → Design page (all tabs)
2. **Share** theme name and version (Settings → Theme)
3. **Check** if Kyoto theme has documentation URL

Most Ghost themes have homepage section controls in:
- Settings → Design → Site-wide
- Settings → Design → Homepage
- Theme settings JSON in Advanced tab

The controls are there - just need to find them in the Kyoto theme interface!
